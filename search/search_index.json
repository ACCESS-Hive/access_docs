In this section, there should be few, very specific use cases that the learner is expected to follow step by step. I think we have had quite a few examples of this at the UM User\u2019s workshop earlier this year, and I would recommend taking those as the basis for this section.</p> <p>I believe that each tutorial should have a very precise path:  Copy out the (specifically prepared) suite x Make some specific changes, e.g. to the model time, add another diagnostic, etc Let it run (should be a cheap model, i.e. low resolution, short time frame) Look at the output.</p> <p>Since the suite should be specifically designed for this task, we have a lot of control over what exactly should happen, and we should be very verbose and specific.</p>"}]}
