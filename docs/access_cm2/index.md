ACCESS-CM2 (ACCESS Coupled Model 2) is a global fully-coupled climate model that includes the atmosphere, ocean and sea-ice components, and produces physical climate simulations. ACCESS-CM2 is one of the two models run by the Australian climate community for the

## ACCESS-CM2 configurations

- Atmosphere model (UM10.6): N96 resolution (1.875° x 1.25°, 85 levels). Physical model only – no carbon cycle.

- Land surface model (CABLE2.5) 

- Ocean model (MOM5): Tripolar grid, 1° resolution, 50 levels.

- Sea ice model (CICE5.1)
