# LFRic Project

[LFRic](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/lfric) is the name given to the programme of work to deliver the software infrastructure and environment to support the development of a replacement for the Unified Model. The name LFRic is chosen in recognition of Lewis Fry Richardson who fantasised parallel computation of weather about a century ago.
