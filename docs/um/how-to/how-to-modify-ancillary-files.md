__um_fileheaders.py__
Field names of all the headers in a UM file. From â€‹https://access-svn.nci.org.au/trac/um/browser/trunk/src/utility/qxreconf/rcf_headaddress_mod.F90. Subtracted 1 from all values so they work with python arrays.

Defines a class with routines for reading and writing UM files. Used by almost everything else. Works with big and little endian, 32 and 64 bit files.

__stashvar.py__
Dictionary with UM STASH variable names indexed by section and item numbers (taken from STASHmaster file). Where available CF standard names and CMIP5 short names are also included.

__levelheights.py__
Calculate true heights of model levels above sea-level, depending on orography

__eqtoll.py__
Rotated grid calculations
