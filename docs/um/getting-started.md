# Getting Started with ACCESS model suites

This section outlines important steps that need to be taken before getting started with tutorials and how-to guides, e.g. NCI and MOSRS accounts, ssh and ssh keys, software setup, etc. 

## UK Met Office Environment on NCI
Installation of the UK Met Office Environment on NCI consists of: the cylc workflow system, rose suites, the Met Office MOSRS repository and our local replica repository as well the model software and tools. 
More information on how to setup your account to use this environment can be found on the [UK MetOffice Environment on NCI](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/DAE/UK+Met+Office+Environment+on+NCI) page.

## Met Office
More general information on how to apply for a Met Office Science Repository Service (MOSR) account can be found on the [Met Office wiki](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/home/wiki/FAQ). 

*Note:* Additional steps are needed on how to get access to Met Office sharepoint and Yammer.
