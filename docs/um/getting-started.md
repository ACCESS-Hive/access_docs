# Getting Started

This section should list important things that need to be set up before getting started with tutorials and how-to guides, e.g. accounts with NCI and MOSRS, ssh and ssh keys, setting up the software, etc. 

## UK Met Office Environment on NCI
The installation of the UK Met Office Environment on NCI consists of: the cylc workflow system; rose suites; the Met Office MOSRS repository and our local replica repository; and the model software and tools. Further information on how to set-up your account to use this environment can be found on the [UK MetOffice Environment on NCI](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/DAE/UK+Met+Office+Environment+on+NCI page).

## Met Office
This [page](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/home/wiki/FAQ) provides more general information on how to apply for a Met Office Science Repository Service (MOSR) account. 
- Note: need to add additional steps on how to obtain access to MetOffice sharepoint and Yammer.
