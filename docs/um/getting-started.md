# Getting Started with ACCESS model suites

This section outlines important steps that need to be taken before getting started with tutorials and how-to guides, e.g. NCI and MOSRS accounts, ssh and ssh keys, software setup, etc. 

## UK Met Office Environment on NCI
Installation of the UK Met Office Environment on NCI consists of: the cylc workflow system, rose suites, the Met Office MOSRS repository and our local replica repository as well the model software and tools. 
More information on how to set-up your account to use this environment can be found on the [UK MetOffice Environment on NCI](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/DAE/UK+Met+Office+Environment+on+NCI) page.

## Met Office
More general information on how to apply for a Met Office Science Repository Service (MOSR) account can be found on the [Met Office wiki](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/home/wiki/FAQ).
