Iris uses ​matplotlib for graphics and ​cartopy (also from the Met Office) for mapping (replacing ​basemap). 

## NCI implementation of the UM rose stem tests
Since vn10.0 there have been NCI versions of some of the UM rose stem tests, e.g. ​https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/um/wiki/StandardJobs. These tests all use identical configurations to the Met Office tests except that for some of the N48 tests small processor decompositions like 2x2 have been converted to use a full node.
