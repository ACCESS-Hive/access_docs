### Part 4: Information-oriented References
This section will be the most technical part of the documentation. A lot of the information that this part is supposed to convey will be the UMDP, especially the technical ones. I think an extensive glossary should also be part of this section.


External Resources that we might point to:
Official UM documentation
Cylc documentation
