# ACCESS Model Configurations

ACCESS Model Configurations combine separate domain-specific model components (e.g., atmosphere, land, ocean and sea ice) into a single model, generally using a coupler, to represent the interactions between the various components of the Earth System. 

The coupler is a software that allows synchronized exchanges of coupling information between numerical codes that represent different components of the climate system.

Depending on the needs of a specific application, different ACCESS model configurations may use a subset of the core component models for atmosphere-only or ocean-only simulations or may replace specific component models.
