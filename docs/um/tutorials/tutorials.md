### Part 1: Learning-oriented Tutorials
The aim of tutorials is to show what the model can do and how to use it. In this section, there should be few, very specific use cases that the learner is expected to follow step by step. I think we have had quite a few examples of this at the UM Userâ€™s workshop earlier this year, and I would recommend taking those as the basis for this section.

I believe that each tutorial should have a very precise path: 
Copy out the (specifically prepared) suite x
Make some specific changes, e.g. to the model time, add another diagnostic, etc
Let it run (should be a cheap model, i.e. low resolution, short time frame)
Look at the output.

Since the suite should be specifically designed for this task, we have a lot of control over what exactly should happen, and we should be very verbose and specific.
