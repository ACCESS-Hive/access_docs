### Tutorials
The aim of learning-oriented tutorials is to show what the model can do and how to use it. In this section, there should be few, very specific use cases that the learner is expected to follow step by step. There were a few examples of this at the UM User’s workshop in Feb 2023 which could be used as the basis for this section. 

Each tutorial should have a precise path: 

1. Copy out the (specifically prepared) *suite x*.
2. Make some specific changes, e.g. to the model time, add another diagnostic, etc. 
3. Let it run (should be a cheap model, i.e. low resolution, short time frame). 
4. Look at the output. 

Since the suite should be specifically designed for this task, the instructions should be verbose and specific. 

Here we could link to the content in the [UM User Tutorial](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/jumps/wiki/UMTutorial2023) that was held from 06-10 February 2023, at the Bureau of Meteorology, Melbourne.
