# ACCESS Models

This site contains documentation that is relevant to ACCESS model configurations, which has been contributed by the ACCESS community. Supplementary documentation can be found on the [ACCESS-Hive](https://access-hive.org.au/) portal, which provides links to documentation hosted on other sites.

Additionally, there is the [ACCESS-Hive Forum](https://forum.access-hive.org.au), which is a space for the ACCESS Community to come together, share information, have fruitful discussions, organise and plan shared activities. This forum is for everyone who is part of the ACCESS Community.
