# UM-Partner resources

The [Unified Model (UM)](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/modelling-systems/unified-model), which is a numerical model of the atmosphere used for both weather and climate applications, has been adopted as the atmospheric model component for the different Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator (ACCESS) model suites.

This site contains UM-related documentation that is relevant to ACCESS configurations, which has been contributed by the ACCESS community. Supplementary documentation can be found on the [ACCESS-Hive](https://access-hive.org.au/) portal, which provides links to documentation hosted on other sites.

Additionally, there is the ACCESS-Hive [Forum](https://forum.access-hive.org.au) which is a space for the ACCESS Community to come together, share information, have fruitful discussions, organise and plan shared activities. This forum is for everyone who is part of the ACCESS Community.
